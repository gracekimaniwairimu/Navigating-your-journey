        <h1>Our Realities</h1>
        <p> In our  constitution it is stated that both men and women are equal, but in the real world  there is no<br> equality.Most women lack job opportunity, simply because the employer thinks a woman cannot do<br> the work well.Also most married women are not allowed to make decisions in their homes and <br>are always blamed for not teaching kids morals.When a girl is pregnant she is always blamed but <br>the person who impregnated her walks free without being asked by anyone. When a  girl is raped<br> she is the one who feels ashamed and people discriminate her and accuse her that it was her<br> fault and  no one blames  the man.In our constitution  safe abortion is a right  but in reality <br>the society does not agree and  this  leads to most girls ending up in the hands of <br>fake specialists and most girls loose their lives in the process.
       
        <h1>How young people should spend  their time</h1>
        <p>Corona virus is affecting everyone, and most yong people are depressed mentally because they are not  <br>interacting with their friends  as they used to.  to avoid this  they should engage themselves with activities<br> that will improve their lives in a positive way. they should  help their parents at home and educate their <br>elders.  They can use their time trying to discover their inner self and what they can do to help the<br> society, for example they can choose to educate their fellow youths using social media. They can<br> also watch videos that might help them to gain new skills and apply them in the society.<br>They can also try and reach out to their friends who are going through tough <br>times and try to help them mentally.<br></p>

        <h1>Stuctures inherited </h1>
       <p>Racism</p>
        <p>Racism of various forms is found  in most countries,the forms that racism takes may be different  for<br> historic,cultural,religious,economic or demographic reasons.
         slavery continues to have an impact<br> on the position of black people in countries today. there is no enough progress toward racial<br> equality, and there is some skepticism, particularly among blacks, that black people will<br> never have equal rights with whites, In America we saw how black people are being<br> descriminated and even killed just because of their race they are seen as the<br> reasons why white countries are having so much problems.We can fixed<br> the issue of racism by educating our society how racism is affecting <br>our progress as  countries.</p>
         <h4>Gender equality</h4>
         <p>In our society men treat women as their properties and dominate  women, as they think that they are to make<br> decisions because women are weak, this puts women down and they are limited to wifely roles.  Men are<br> also given greater task than women in work places.We can resolve this by educating our young<br> girls to be stronger as they can do even better that men. </p>
        <p>Cash</p>
        <p>We inherited the use of cash from colonial which works best in our countries because the economy<br> grows each day.</p>
