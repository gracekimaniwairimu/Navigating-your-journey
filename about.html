        <h1>Our Realities</h1>
        <p> In our  constitution it is stated that both men and women are equal, but in the real world <br> there is no equality.Most women lack job opportunity, simply because the employer thinks a woman<br> cannot do the work well.Also most married women are not allowed to make decisions in their homes<br> and are always blamed for not teaching kids morals.When a girl is pregnant she is always<br> blamed but the person who impregnated her walks free without being asked by anyone. When a<br> girl is raped she is the one who feels ashamed and people discriminate her and accuse <br>her that it was her fault and  no one blames  the man.<br>In our constitution  safe abortion is a right  but in reality the<br> society does not agree and  this  leads to most girls ending up in the hands of <br>fake specialists and most girls loose their lives in the process.
       
        <h1>How young people should spend  their time</h1>
        <p>Corona virus is affecting everyone, and most yong people are depressed mentally because Many young people are not <br> interacting with their friends  as they used to.  to avoithis  they should engage themselves with activities<br> that will improve their lives in a positive way. they should  help their parents at home and educate  their elders.  <br>They can use their time trying to discover their inner self and what they can do to help the society, <br>for example they can choose to educate their fellow youths using social media.<br> They can also watch videos that might help them to gain new skills and apply them in the society.They can <br>also try and reach out to their friend who are going through tough times and try to help them mentally<br></p>

        <h1>Stuctures inherited </h1>
       <p>Racism</p>
        <p>Racism of various forms is found  in most countries,the forms that racism takes may be different  for<br> historic,cultural,religious,economic or demographic reasons.
         slavery continues to have an impact<br> on the position of black people in countries today. there is no enough progress toward<br> racial equality, and there is some skepticism, particularly among blacks, that black people will<br> ever have equal rights with whites, In America we saw how black people are <br>being descriminated and even killed just because of their race they are seen as the reasons <br>why white countries are having so much problems.We can fixed the issue of racism <br>by educating our society how racism is affecting our progress as  countries</p>
         <h4>Gender equality</h4>
         <p>In our society men treat women as their properties and dominate  women, as the think that they are to make decisions<br> because women are weak, this puts women down and they are limited to wifely roles.  Men are also given <br>greater task than women in work places.We can resolve this by educating our young<br> girls to be stronger as they can do even better that men. </p>
        <p>Cash</p>
        <p>We inherited the use of cash from colonial which works best in our countries because the economy<br> grows each day.</p>
