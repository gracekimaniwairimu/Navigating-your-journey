     <div class="h1">Journey to confidence</div>
        <p>All my life I have been struggling with confidence.Some of the things that hindered me from being confident enough is <strong>self doubt</strong> where by I never had a chance to express myself in schools or in public places.I have always wanted to be an extarvert where i can talk about what i feel and what I think but the fear held me back.When I was a little girl I would do things to seek validation from others this affected me so much because If I was not given the best feedback that would break my life and I would go silent for a long time. </p>

        <div class="h1">What I have learnt</div>
        <p>What I have learnt from this journey is that Confidence is a tool you should always carry with you,you dont look for it whenever you have a job interview. You should Build it slowly and keep on woking on it.Confidence is all about trying doing something until its done, and being  able to defend whatever you do.Curiosity and confidence goes together, when you are confident  you should be curious to know beyond what you know.We should consider confidence as a revolutionary chance  because without it we get stuck and fail to get started.
